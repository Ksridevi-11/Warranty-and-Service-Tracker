â€¢	Service Requests logged online, automatically assigned to agents.
â€¢	Dashboards track active/expired warranties and open/closed service requests.

4. Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis

 6. Standard vs. Custom Objects (Gap Analysis)
 ðŸ‘‰ Goal: Decide which Salesforce objects to reuse and which to build.
â€¢	Account
â€ƒâ€ƒâ†’ Reuse for Customer/Company (no changes needed).
â€¢	Contact
â€ƒâ€ƒâ†’ Reuse for Individual Customer (no changes needed).
â€¢	Case
â€ƒâ€ƒâ†’ Could be reused for Service Requests, but for learning we will create a custom object Service_Request__c.
â€¢	Product (Product2)
â€ƒâ€ƒâ†’ Could be reused for Products, but it is missing fields like Serial Number and Warranty Term.
â€ƒâ€ƒâ†’ We will create a custom Product__c object with these fields.
